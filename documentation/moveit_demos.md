Here we showcase a small overview of the `demo.launch` files that use the [Moveit config package](https://github.com/GitSRealpe/abb_irb140_ros_sim/wiki/3.-Moveit-config-package) for this project. This demos allow the use of the Moveit motion planning framework using a GUI plugin in RViz, you can command a desired goal (in terms of Cartesian pose or joint space goal) to the robot using an interactive marker, the request to Moveit thee motion planning and execution of that desired goal.<br>

> **Note**: Once again, this is something that the Moveit and ROS developers have covered completely with tutorials and guides, here we just show how it was made/implemented for this specific project, so if you want to cover this more in depth, refer to the [Moveit RViz Plugin Tutorial](http://docs.ros.org/en/indigo/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/ros_visualization/visualization_tutorial.html).

Just like the initial bringups, we have tow demos to use de Moveit RViz plugin, one where only the robot description is loaded and visualized in RViz, and the other in Gazebo, where the configured joint controllers are used an also the robot con interact with physics objects.

## RViz Moveit demo
As the title says, this [launch file](https://github.com/GitSRealpe/abb_irb140_ros_sim/blob/noetic/irb140_moveit_bin_pick/launch/demo.launch) provides and RViz bringup which loads the robot description, the Moveit required components for the robot motion planning like the `planning_context.launch` and the `move_group.launch`. This demo is executed running the following command:<br>
`roslaunch irb140_moveit_bin_pick demo.launch`.<br>
An RViz window will load up with the robot and the Moveit plugin, to move the robot just use the interactive marker and request a _Plan&Execute_ task in the _Planning_ tab.

This launch file is generated by the [Moveit Setup Assistant](https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/doc/setup_assistant/setup_assistant_tutorial.html?highlight=setup) itself, the specific file of this project has some minor modifications, but is pretty close to the original one.
